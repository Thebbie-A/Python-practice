# Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be
# calculated with the following formula:
# Distance = Speed * Time
# A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
# • The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
# • The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
# • The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

speed = 70
distance_in_6hrs = 70 * 6
distance_in_10hrs = 70 * 10
distance_in_15hrs = 70 * 15

print(distance_in_6hrs)
print(distance_in_10hrs)
print(distance_in_15hrs)
