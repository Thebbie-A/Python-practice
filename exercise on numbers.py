# Write a program that can find out an area of a triangle whose base is 15 meter and height is 22 meter.
# The mathematical equation for an area of a triangle is: Area = Â½*Base*Height.


base = 15
height = 22
area_of_triangle = 1/2 * int(height) * int(base)
# finding the area
area_of_a_triangle = 0.5 * 15 * 22
print(area_of_triangle)



# You bought 9 packets of potato chips from a store.
# Each packet costs 1.49 dollar and you gave shopkeeper 20 dollar. Find out using python,
# how many dollars is the shopkeeper going to give you back?
# Write a program to find this out.

# total packet of chips bought from the store
total_chips_bought = 9
each_chip = 1.49
amount_paid = 20
amount_balanced = int(amount_paid) - (9 * 1.49)
print(amount_balanced)
# round(6.59, 1)



# 3. The bathroom of your home is an exact square. You want to replace tiles in it. Length of this
# bathroom is 5.5 feet. How many square foot of tiles you need to buy? Equation for an area of a square is:
# Area = Length to the power of 2.
# Write python program to figure this out.


actual_length = 4
length_of_bathroom = 5.5
area_of_square = 5.5 ** 2
print(area_of_square)
# round(area_of_square,1)
